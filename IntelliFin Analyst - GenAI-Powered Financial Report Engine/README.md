# IntelliFin Analyst - GenAI-Powered Financial Report Engine ðŸš€

## Problem Statement  
Manual analysis of financial reports, such as SEC filings, is time-consuming (4-6 hours per filing) and error-prone (18% misinterpretation rate). This project aims to automate the extraction of key insights, identify financial anomalies, and generate executive summaries from complex financial documents with high accuracy and efficiency.
