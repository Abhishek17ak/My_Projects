This project was created during my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Engineering, represents my initial foray into software development. The Restaurant Management System is designed to streamline operations in both lodging and restaurant sections. The system incorporates features such as room booking, order placement, and administrative functionalities. Users can book rooms, view bookings, order food from a menu, and track orders. The project, implemented in C programming language, demonstrates fundamental programming concepts, including file handling, user input validation, and menu-driven interfaces. The user-friendly console application utilizes file storage to maintain records of room bookings and food orders. This project reflects my foundational programming skills and the application of theoretical knowledge to practical software development scenarios. I am excited to share this project on my GitHub repository as a testament to my early exploration of coding and problem-solving in the field of computer science.
