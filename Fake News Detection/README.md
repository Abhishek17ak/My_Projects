# About the Project

## Development and Training of a Bidirectional LSTM Model for Automated Fake News Detection

In a recent project, I successfully developed and trained a Bidirectional LSTM-based deep
learning model to detect fake news within various news corpora. Utilizing TensorFlow along with
several Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK, Spacy, Gensim,
and Keras, I automated the news verification process, significantly reducing the need for manual
intervention in media companies. My role covered all aspects of the machine learning pipeline,
from data preprocessing (including advanced tokenization and stop words removal) to
exploratory data analysis with engaging visualizations like word clouds. I meticulously
engineered and optimized the neural network architecture, ensuring precise model performance
evaluation. This initiative not only sharpened my skills in natural language processing and deep
learning but also supported efforts to uphold news authenticity
