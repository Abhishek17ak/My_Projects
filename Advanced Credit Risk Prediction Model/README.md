# Advanced Credit Risk Prediction Model

## Overview
This project develops an Advanced Credit Risk Prediction Model to enhance the accuracy of credit risk assessments within the financial services sector. By leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, the model transforms the loan approval process, thereby helping financial institutions reduce credit losses and improve operational efficiency.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **Scikit-learn**: Used for implementing machine learning models
- **XGBoost**: Employed for its gradient boosting capabilities which enhance the model's performance

## Project Description
The Advanced Credit Risk Prediction Model uses logistic regression and gradient boosting techniques, analyzing data from over 10,000 individuals. This robust application of technology enhances predictability and reliability in the evaluation of creditworthiness.

### Key Achievements
- **Improved Accuracy**: The model's accuracy reached an AUC score of 0.92, which is indicative of its high reliability in predicting credit risk.
- **Reduction of Errors**: There was a 25% reduction in false positives and a 30% reduction in false negatives, leading to more accurate credit assessments.
- **Operational Efficiency**: The model streamlined the loan approval process, which not only speeds up the decision-making process but also reduces potential losses from credit defaults.
