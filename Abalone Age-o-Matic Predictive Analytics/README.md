# Abalone Age-o-Matic Predictive Analytics

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the age of abalone from physical measurements. The age of abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope—a time-consuming and somewhat subjective process. Predicting the age using physical measurements could be faster and less subjective.

## Problem Statement
The challenge is to predict the number of rings on the abalone shell, which directly correlates to their age. The number of rings is a discrete value that makes this task a regression problem.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used for this project includes several measurements from abalone specimens. Each entry in the dataset consists of the following features:
- **Sex**: M, F, and I (infant)
- **Length**: Longest shell measurement (mm)
- **Diameter**: Perpendicular to the length (mm)
- **Height**: With meat in the shell (mm)
- **Whole weight**: Whole abalone weight
- **Shucked weight**: Weight of the meat
- **Viscera weight**: Gut weight (after bleeding)
- **Shell weight**: After being dried
- **Rings**: +1.5 gives the age in years (target variable)

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning tools
  - `train_test_split`: Splitting data into training and test sets
  - `StandardScaler`: Feature scaling
  - `GradientBoostingRegressor`, `RandomForestRegressor`: Regression models
  - `Pipeline`: Streamlining workflows
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**: Data visualization

## Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Encoded categorical data using one-hot encoding.
   - Standardized numerical features to have zero mean and unit variance.
   - Engineered features such as polynomial features to capture nonlinear relationships.

2. **Model Building**:
   - Used multiple regression models to evaluate their baseline performance.
   - Utilized a pipeline to streamline preprocessing and model training.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - The models were evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE) to penalize underestimations more severely than overestimations.
   - Performed comparative analysis to select the best performing model.

4. **Results**:
   - Documented model performance metrics including RMSLE, MSE, and R² score.
   - Identified key predictors of abalone age.
