# About the Project
n spearheading a groundbreaking research project on university rankings, I conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis utilizing datasets from 4icu.org, WalletHub, and Forbes, incorporating information from over 800 global institutions. Through meticulous data preprocessing, including addressing discrepancies in university counts and name variations, I achieved a notable 10% reduction in mean squared error (MSE) by introducing innovative features such as Selectivity-to-Quality Ratio and Cost-Quality Ratio. Implementing both linear regression and neural network models, I successfully captured the intricate dynamics of university rankings, achieving a high generalization ability with an MSE score of 13.29 on the test set after 350 training epochs. This research significantly advances our understanding of the multifaceted factors influencing institutional success, offering stakeholders invaluable insights beyond traditional metrics.
