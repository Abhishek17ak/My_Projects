# March Madness Machine Learning Mastery 2024

## Overview
This project involves forecasting the outcomes of the 2024 collegiate basketball tournaments for both men's and women's teams as part of the March Machine Learning Mania 2024 on Kaggle. Utilizing historical NCAA games data, this project aims to combine advanced machine learning techniques to predict game outcomes, thereby refining the science of "bracketology" traditionally driven by instincts and simpler statistical methods.

## Competition Details
- **Competition**: [March Machine Learning Mania 2024](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/march-machine-learning-mania-2024)
- **Task**: Submit a portfolio of bracket predictions for NCAA men's and women's basketball tournaments.
- **Data**: Extensive historical data on NCAA basketball games, with separate files for men's and women's game data. Additional data from external sources can be incorporated to enhance predictions.
- **Period**: February 27, 2024 - April 9, 2024

## Dataset Description
Participants are provided with detailed historical data on NCAA basketball games, including:
- Game results for regular seasons and tournaments.
- Statistical performance metrics of teams across various seasons.
- Data files are prefixed with 'M' for men's and 'W' for women's data, encompassing metrics like team scores, player performance, and more.

## Methodology
### Data Preparation
- **Data Cleaning and Integration**: Cleaning datasets and integrating men's and women's data for comprehensive analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Generating new features from raw data to better capture the dynamics of the games.

### Model Development
- **Predictive Modeling**: Utilizing models like XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks to predict outcomes.
- **Validation**: Implementing cross-validation to ensure the robustness of the models.

### Evaluation
- **Baseline Comparison**: Setting a baseline prediction based on historical seeds and comparing advanced models against this baseline.
- **Accuracy Metrics**: Using accuracy and F1-score to measure the effectiveness of different models.
