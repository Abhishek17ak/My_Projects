# About the Project
My project, "Algorithmic Trading Model Development," involved the creation and implementation of sophisticated trading strategies using quantitative and machine learning techniques. The project encompasses diverse aspects such as feature engineering, statistical analysis, and machine learning model construction to predict stock price movements. I explored various models, including Linear Regression, Light Gradient Boosting, and a Neural Network, evaluating their performance through metrics like Mean Absolute Error. Additionally, the project incorporates exploratory data analysis, autocorrelation analysis, clustering, and network analysis to gain insights into market dynamics. By addressing challenges related to data preprocessing, feature selection, and model tuning, I demonstrated proficiency in handling financial data and implementing effective strategies for algorithmic trading. This project showcases my expertise in quantitative analysis, machine learning, and financial modeling, providing a comprehensive view of my skills in the domain of algorithmic trading.
