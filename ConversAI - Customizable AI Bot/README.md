# ConversAI: Empowering AI Customization and Accessibility

## Problem Statement

Conversational AI has transformed human-computer interaction, yet significant challenges remain in making this technology accessible and customizable for diverse users. These challenges include:

1. Complex customization processes requiring extensive technical knowledge
2. Time-intensive development for even minor adjustments
3. Lack of domain-specific adaptability in generic AI models
4. Interfaces that are intimidating to non-technical users
5. Limited inclusivity for users with disabilities

## Project Overview

ConversAI addresses these challenges by leveraging the Botpress platform to enhance both customization and accessibility of conversational AI. The project focuses on two primary pillars:

1. AI-Driven Customization: Users can directly interact with the AI to define and refine custom models tailored to their unique requirements. The system employs modular components that adapt dynamically to different domains.

2. AI-Driven Accessibility: We combine traditional Infrastructure as Code (IaC) methods with AI-driven, low-code/no-code interfaces to simplify the setup process. Users can configure their AI systems as easily as assembling LEGO blocks, making the platform more approachable.

This project was developed as part of the final project for CSE542/AMS560: Big Data Systems, Algorithms and Networks in the Master's in Data Science program at Stony Brook University.
