#Medical Insurance Premium Prediction with Machine Learning

In this project-based course, we will build, train and test a machine learning model to predict insurance cost based on customer features such as age, gender, Body Mass Index (BMI), number of children, smoking habits, and geo-location. This guided project is practical and directly applicable to the insurance industry.
Learning Objectives
Perform data cleaning, feature engineering and visualization
