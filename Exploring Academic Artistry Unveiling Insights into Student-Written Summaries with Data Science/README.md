# About Project
This data science project aims to analyze and explore the CommonLit Challenge dataset, focusing on evaluating the quality of written summaries produced by grade school children. The provided code begins with the installation of necessary packages and data loading from two CSV files. The subsequent sections involve feature engineering, exploring data distributions, identifying over-represented and under-represented words, and creating insightful visualizations. The baseline models, implemented with linear regression, are then assessed for content and wording scores. The project progresses to feature cleaning and normalization, followed by the creation of two additional models using linear regression and a different algorithm (Random Forest). The performance of these models is compared, providing insights into their effectiveness. Overall, this project combines exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning to gain insights into the factors influencing the quality of student-written summaries in the CommonLit Challenge dataset.
