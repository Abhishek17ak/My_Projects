# About This Project
Title: Driver Fatigue Detection System

Description:
The "Driver Fatigue Detection System" is a comprehensive Android-based application developed as a final year project for a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at DYPCET, Kolhapur. The primary objective of this project is to enhance road safety by addressing the critical issue of driver fatigue, a major cause of road accidents.

The application utilizes facial recognition technology, powered by Google's Vision API, to monitor the driver's eyes for signs of drowsiness or fatigue. A front-facing camera captures real-time images of the driver's face, and a custom-built face tracking algorithm analyzes key facial features such as the eyes. The system calculates probabilities of eye closure, indicating levels of drowsiness. When the probability exceeds a predefined threshold, the system triggers an alert mechanism.

To further enhance the safety features, the application incorporates GPS tracking to determine the driver's current location. In the event of prolonged driver fatigue, the system automatically sends distress SMS messages to predefined emergency contacts. These messages include the driver's location coordinates, allowing family members or emergency services to respond promptly.

The application also provides a user-friendly interface for configuring settings such as emergency contact numbers and sensitivity thresholds. Additionally, a Flash Activity serves as a splash screen, ensuring a smooth transition to the main application.

The project demonstrates a multidisciplinary approach, combining computer vision, mobile development, and location-based services to create an innovative solution for addressing a significant societal challenge. The inclusion of a timer-based system ensures continuous monitoring during the driving session, offering real-time updates and alerts. This project represents a valuable contribution to the field of road safety technology, showcasing the capabilities of emerging technologies to mitigate risks associated with driver fatigue.
