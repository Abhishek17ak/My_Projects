# AI-Driven Disease Detection through Medical Imaging

## Overview
This project focuses on the development of an AI-driven disease detection system using medical imaging. By leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), this model aims to assist healthcare professionals by enhancing the accuracy and speed of diagnosing diseases from medical images.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language for implementing the model.
- **TensorFlow**: An open-source machine learning framework used for building the CNN model.
- **Keras**: A high-level neural networks API, used for fast experimentation and to simplify TensorFlow operations.

## Project Description
The AI-Driven Disease Detection model utilizes advanced machine learning techniques to analyze over 5,000 medical images, effectively identifying specific conditions such as tumors and fractures. The project demonstrates the powerful application of AI in medical diagnostics, which could significantly improve patient care outcomes.

### Key Achievements
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved a 95% accuracy rate in detecting specific medical conditions, which is critical for reliable medical diagnostics.
- **Diagnostic Precision**: Attained a sensitivity (true positive rate) of 93% and a specificity (true negative rate) of 97%, highlighting the model's ability to accurately identify disease presence and absence.
- **Support to Healthcare Professionals**: The modelâ€™s high performance underscores its potential as a tool for healthcare providers, aiding them in making faster and more accurate diagnoses.
