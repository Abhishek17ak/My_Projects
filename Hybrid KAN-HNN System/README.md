# Hybrid KAN-HNN Architecture for Conservative Dynamical Systems

## Overview
This project introduces a **Hybrid KAN-HNN Architecture**, a novel framework designed to model conservative dynamical systems while preserving physical principles like energy conservation and symplectic structure. The architecture combines **Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)** for efficient function approximation using B-splines and **Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs)** to enforce physics-informed constraints.

By integrating data-driven learning with first-principles physics, this hybrid model achieves long-term stability, interpretability, and computational efficiency, making it ideal for scientific simulations and engineering applications.

## Key Features
- **Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN):**
  - Utilizes B-spline-based activation functions for feature extraction and function approximation.
  - Provides interpretability through spline visualizations.
  
- **Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNN):**
  - Encodes Hamiltonian mechanics to preserve energy conservation and symplectic structure.
  - Ensures physically consistent predictions without post-hoc regularization.

- **Applications:**
