# ShareBite: Addressing Food Distribution Challenges
Project Overview:

ShareBite is a mobile application developed as part of a third-year project during the 6th semester of the Bachelor's program in Computer Science and Engineering at DYPCET, Kolhapur. The project aims to tackle food distribution challenges by creating a platform that connects food donors with those in need. The app facilitates the donation and reception of food items, fostering a community-driven approach to address hunger and food wastage.

Key Features:

The application features a user-friendly interface that allows individuals to register either as donors or receivers. Donors can input details about the food items they wish to contribute, including the type of food and a brief description. Receivers, on the other hand, can browse available food items and request donations based on their needs. The inclusion of geolocation ensures that donations are made to nearby recipients, optimizing the logistics of food distribution.

Technological Stack:

The project utilizes Android development with Java, integrating Firebase for user authentication and real-time data storage. The RecyclerView in conjunction with Firebase Firestore is employed to display and manage the list of available food items. The geolocation feature enhances the user experience by connecting donors with receivers in close proximity.

Outcome and Impact:

ShareBite is not merely a technical endeavor but a social initiative aimed at making a positive impact on the community. By leveraging technology to streamline the process of food donation, the project addresses the challenges of food distribution and promotes a sustainable solution to reduce food wastage. The application was developed during the 6th semester, showcasing the practical application of theoretical knowledge gained throughout the academic curriculum.
